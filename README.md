# CPPND: Capstone Pomodoro Repo

This is a repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213).

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application starting with this repo, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Project Proposal

In this project I have chosen an app, which I also use almost every day: A Pomodoro Timer. The Pomodoro technique divides work or learning into regular intervals of varying length. Roughly speaking, it is used for time management. It consists of two phases that alternate regularly: The focus phase of 25 minutes and the short break of 5 minutes. The focus phase is also called Pomodoro and after every four Pomodoros there is a longer break of 15 minutes. My daily goal is to complete 12 Pomodoros, which is also displayed in the GUI.

In addition, I have added the possibility to play a sound file, which is built into the app as a binary file when compiling. This MP3 is thus always available, does not have to be searched for on the computer and also explains why the executable file is about 12 MiB in size. This so-called white noise sound is played in an infinite loop and is generated by a continuum of frequencies evenly distributed over the entire audible range.

Apparently white noise has been shown to enhance brain states for learning in adults. Furthermore it can help to camouflage the annoyance caused by tinnitus or mask background noises in the office.

Finally, there is an option to reset the current phase to 25 minutes and also two buttons to stop the timer and increase or decrease it by one minute at a time. This allows a finer adjustment and also subsequent saving of the completed Pomodoros.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
